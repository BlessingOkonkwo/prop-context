## Description

The React Context API is a powerful feature that allows for efficient state management and sharing data between components without passing props through intermediate components. This repository serves as a playground for exploring the Context API and understanding its usage in different scenarios.

In addition to the Context API, this project also focuses on utilizing the `props.children` pattern. React's `props.children` allows components to have dynamic content passed as child elements. Understanding how to effectively use `props.children` can enhance component reusability and provide a more flexible component structure.

## Features

- Basic setup of a React application
- Implementation of the Context API for state management
- Usage of `props.children` to pass dynamic content to components
- Example components and usage patterns demonstrating the concepts
